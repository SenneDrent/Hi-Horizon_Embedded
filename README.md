IMPORTANT: this repo has been moved to the Hi-Horizon orginization you can find it here: https://github.com/Hi-Horizon/Hi-Horizon_telemetry_dashboard2
# Hi-Horizon_Embedded
This repository contains all the code used by the microcontroller on board of the raceboat. Its purpose is to collect data of power consumption and gain, speed and status of the boat. And display this on a screen and website through MQTT protocol.

## Setting up the work enviroment
If you want to use the system or contribute to the codebase, first clone main to your PC.

One part of the codebase are Arduino Framework projects made in the [platformIO](https://platformio.org/) visual studio code plugin.
The other part are [STM32CubeIde](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/stm32cubeide.html) projects.
Read the [Wiki](https://github.com/SenneDrent/Hi-Horizon_Embedded/wiki) to check which one you should use and how to set this up.
